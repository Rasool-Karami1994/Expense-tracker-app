### Reflection

-Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I built an app for add daily financial transactions to it and manage them with search, add and calculete the budget in my wallet.

I used React and Css for building this project and I practiced useEffect and useState hooks and components conditional rendering.
